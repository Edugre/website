For my homepage assginemnt I did a guided project for a digital portfolio
learning much more about HTML CSS and bootstrap

HTML Tags used:
html
body
main
div
meta
link
nav
ul
li
a
button
path
svg
g
section
p
h2
footer
span
script

I used a custom Styles.css that mixes bootstrap css with my own personal modifications
CSS properties implemented of my own:
text-decoration
data-bs-theme
background-color
transition
color

For JavaScript I implemented a dark theme toggle on my website
which toggles between light and dark mode by clicking themeToggle button
and stores the preferred theme of the user
